# Predictive Modeling of Telco Customer Churn Dataset

🌐 Data belongs to a arbitrary comapany named Telco.

🎯 Out goal is to create a best possible model to predict 'Customer Churn' based on various features.

🤖 The notebook `xgboost.ipynb` implements all the necessary steps to create, and at the same time, the required observations to create the model according to our needs. 
In this case, I have chosen 'XgBoost', but this can be extended further to try models using other algorithms.

🤝 I welcome you to make any kind of contributions, be it any new models or betterment of the existing one.

### Thank You!
